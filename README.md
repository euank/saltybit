saltybit
========

Due to how the site [SaltyBet](http://www.saltybet.com/) works,
it's favourable to bet a little _bit_ at complete random. This
is due to how it always rounds up.

This is a trival betting bot which follows that philosophy by 
always betting exactly 1 salty buck at random.


Unfortunately, betting bots are against the saltybet rules
(see the faq) so this should never be used other than for
learning purposes.

TODO
----

Originally I was planning to also gather statistics over time to influence who
to bet the 1 salty buck on, but since I learned bots to be against the rules
it's quite possible that plan will not be realized.
